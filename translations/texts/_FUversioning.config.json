At worst, you should experience only oxygen related issues.\n \n  * Honed Lunari Cestus got a hefty nerf\n  \n  * reduced damage on the Extra Dungeons legendary claws. They were simply far, far too good.\n  \n  * new playable race: Radien (Moonlit Comet)\n\n  \n  _____________________________________________________  \n  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.195^reset;\n  \n  * Assault Armor can now be dyed\n  \n  * Mechanical farm animals should properly ingest oil\n  \n  * Upgrade, Manipulator and Tech module recipes have been changed to use Research rather than Essence\n  \n  * Added BK12 Manstopper [machine pistol] (Pillow Bunny)\n  \n  * added Honed Lunari Cestus (Kreon the Insane)\n  \n  * added more info to the Info windows.

You now only hear it occasionally when more than 120 mites are in your apiary\n  \n  * Mite infection spreads faster after only 10 appear, rather than 60.

Max stack size is 300.\n  \n   - Mites slow (and eventually completely stop) bee production. They are also a pain in the butt to get rid of without the right frames.\n \n   - Dead mites have a chance to convert into Bug Shell\n   \n   - You can feed mites to your farm animals. They suck as food, though.\n   \n   - More mite changes *will* be coming soon\n  \n\n  \n  * ^orange;Tray balance changes^reset; and feedback improvements (ProfoundDarkness) :\n  \n  - Fixed a bug causing perennial seed loss when improving fertilizer.\n  \n  - Trays are no longer set and forget with perennial plants. Should think of 'Yield Count' as the number of plants being grown. With poor fertilizer choices one should expect seed loss now.\n  \n  - Perennial growth bonus sticks around from growth ending to the next starting if the same seed. So can pause growth and resume later to still get the bonus (if any defined in seed).\n  \n  - Hydroponics tray, when powered, is faster than Growing Tray. About the same speed unpowered.\n  \n  - Some liquid items in the water slot slightly improve growing speed.\n  \n  - Invalid water/fertilizer items in said slots will be 'rejected' into tray storage if there is room.\n  \n  - Can interrupt perennial plants starting their next growth cycle the same way as annual plants, by placing any non-seed item in the seed slot.\n\n\n\n  * the Dragon Pistol boss drop can now be upgraded in a Crucible\n  \n  * Psilamanders touch attack now causes weak poison\n  \n  * Nightcrutters have new attacks\n  \n  * Wickins now have a defensive attack\n  \n  * Anglure variants got some minor attack adjustments\n  \n  * new mob: Meat Bunny!

Sadly not retroactive. (Khe)\n  \n  _____________________________________________________\n  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.192^reset;\n  \n  * mushroom men can now be captured\n  \n  * added console category under tool 'category' for ITD\n  \n  * adds missing itemdescriptions for unique weapon tooltips\n  \n  * Telebrium, Tauntra and Neutron Orbs now count as 'energy' weapons for set bonuses\n  \n  * Chickens are now omnivorous\n  \n  * Herbivores and Omnivores can now eat wheat\n  \n  _____________________________________________________\n  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.191^reset;\n  \n  * Giant Scented Apiary no longer has a drone count limit, and its spawn delay has been reduced from 1.05 to 0.8 to match the Giant Apiary.\n  \n  * Boomerangs can now collect items\n  \n  * New tech: Regen Field\n  \n  * New Tech: Defense Matrix I, II and III.

It is far more useful now. Base damage is maxEnergy/3.5. Timer increased to 1.5 seconds.\n    - Increased activation cost from 2 to 30.

This should make barren slightly more common and remove Sulphuric from Tier 1 stars in the bargain.\n  \n  _____________________________________________________\n  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.190^reset;\n  \n  \n  * The information is based on what is CURRENTLY in the tray slots, not what it's growing. So you can pick out the right fertilizer and liquid THEN insert your seed of choice.\n  \n  * Also removed racial descriptions from hydroponics trays as that was hiding useful information from players (ie power draw) using the stock Starbound races.\n  \n  * Modified description on both trays to remove the explicit number of seeds. \n  \n  * Insanity effect corrected\n  \n  * removed Red Desert and Blood Gulch subbiomes from Atropus biomes\n  \n  * Physics Field tech base direction is now 0, meaning you will not move upwards automatically. \n  \n  * fixed a quest loophole for Silicon Knight.

Inspired by Flail weapons by ThatThunderCookie. They are mid-damage, mid-range block-breaking flails.

Crit Chance bonus reduced to 2%\n  \n  _____________________________________________________\n  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.188^reset;\n  \n  * Reverts the 'activate ship' entity message in bootship.lua back to just a message instead of a promise due to issues with mods like Avali when choicing the default ship (will make it so that the SAIL text that appears after bootup won't always appear on BYOS ships again)\n  \n  * adds new sounds to the Warden\n  \n  * adjusts loot in the Cavern dungeon end room and secret room\n  \n  * Robotic pets can now ingest Oil, Lead, Silicon and Carbon and Spare Parts (yes, they'll eat their crap)\n  _____________________________________________________\n  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.187^reset;\n  \n  * fixes baby ironbeaks growing into copperbeaks\n  \n  * copperbeak and ironbeak babies will accept alienmeat rather than cattlefeed thrown on the ground\n  \n  * added missing unlock for Pesticide\n\n  * Warden now properly animates and behaves differently\n  \n  * fixing a strange monument's category. formerly 'pot', now 'decorative' (Kherae)\n  \n  * added a description adjustment for the transferutil variant of the itemscanner.
