This means Avali are screwed for now. However, we may opt to release an addon that loads after all the custom races to combat this issue. Have patience!\n    Note that this also means any race mod that loads after FU , in general, will have the same issue. \n  \n  * adds a few more races supported by new SAIL\n  \n  * Tool Upgrade Table now tells you the tools it works on, and the tools also inform you where they can be upgraded.\n  \n  * new armor set: Researcher. Unlocked by accessing a tier 2 or 3 Armory. (TimothyWiggins)\n  \n  * scripted AI lattice mod should properly function in tandem with FU SAIL\n\n  * added Ferozium, Violium and Aegisalt to the Precursor Duplicator output options.\n  \n  * Protectorate Broadsword upgrade added\n  \n  * adjusted upgrade name for the broken broadsword\n  \n  * adjusts racializer code (Hubnester)\n  \n  * adds more sloped glass blocks (SentientCookie)\n  \n_____________________________________________________\n  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.240^reset;\n\n  * added Huge, Mega, Mammoth and other large sizes back to other biome types besides Gas Giants. This applies to FU star types only. Starter systems have only as high as Huge worlds to prevent exorbitant travel times before gaining mobility Techs.\n  \n  * oceans should no longer generate to the atmosphere when generated as Small sized planets.\n  \n  * Avali, Blattra, Elithian Races and Felin should all have proper access to the new SAIL interface. As before, please inform if your race is not getting it so we can correct it.\n  \n_____________________________________________________\n  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.239^reset;\n\n  * new icons for space missions, stations etc (Rylasasin, me)\n  \n  * NEW : SAIL interface (zimberzimber). This should give you more info in-game as to your current status, as well as provide all the info SAIL previously did. Should be compatible with just about everything. If your race does not see a new SAIL console, let us know.\n  \n  * Pretty straightforward. Park ship on the orbit of planet, and Atmospheric Condenser will collect planetary resources, like it's built on the surface. (Vollch)\n  \n  * added delicious Face Skin\n  \n  * new gather/completion method for Precursor Dungeon and Delta Freya unlocks\n  \n  * added Sinco mech parts to FU. Thanks for permissions from Sinful Creature!\n  \n  * the MatMod Placer can now create Weather Protection mod, which will coat tiles and prevent them from picking up weather-based coatings appearing on tiles (Remi)\n  \n  * Made it effectively impossible to miss with bombs in the distortion sphere hall within the Dark Caverns. If you can't hit the door now, you have issues. I mean, c'mon guys...\n  \n  * added text nag for the above door just so there is absolutely no more confusion.\n  \n  * adds universe flag to techscientist4 quest , since it is normally set in 6, and 6 is no longer used. This should enable you to obtain the Tech Console, though the Tech Tablet is still better anyhow!\n  \n  * Core Spear is no longer missing primary attack sound\n  \n  * Dodge II has +7% Bash chance, and +2 distance to inflicted bashes\n  \n  * changed Dodge tech icons to be more distinct from Dash\n  \n  * Updates the ship sprite for the Tier 6, Tier 7 and Tier 8 Kirhos Ship (Gainem, Hubnester)\n  * THE IMAGE AND BLOCKS WILL NOT LINE UP WITH PREEXISTING TIER 5 or 8 KIRHOS SHIP (only ones that were at tier 5 or 8 before this update) \n  \n_____________________________________________________\n  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.238^reset;\n  \n  * Adds BYOS support for Slime Race and Elithian Races \n  \n  * Dodge II should be properly craftable\n  \n  \n_____________________________________________________\n  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.237^reset;\n\n  * Slight changes to the Dark Caverns to force a path through the dungeon\n  \n  * Apiary 'Mite Alarm' sound effect now only plays if an apiary has over 360 mites inside.\n  \n  * relocated unlock for Mech mining lasers to the Mech Drill II.\n  \n  * Elder Grappling Hook can now grant energy and shadow resist when extended. It also handles more efficiently.\n  \n  * Stormwarden should no longer spawn as PGI\n  \n  * Techs no longer display the 'chip' graphic type.\n  \n  * Phase Attack tech has been rebalanced\n    * it now bases power on *remaining* energy. As it drains your energy, its power increases.\n    * maximum boost is now much lower than previously.\n    \n  * the Dodge tech is less crappy!\n    * slightly increased distance\n    * provides a small defense boost while active\n    * provides +5% chance to Shield Bash and + 2 to Shield Bash distance\n    * cooldown increased from 0.2s to 0.25s\n    \n  * Dodge now has an upgrade that makes it even better!  \n  \n  * Blastcannon pistol has been rebalanced to not be impossibly good for Novakids when paired with FrackinRaces. \n    * It no longer provides both shotgun and pistol tags.\n    * Its damage is reduced by 0.5\n    * Its energy consumption is increased from 22 to 24\n    * It is slightly more accurate\n    \n_____________________________________________________\n  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.236^reset;\n  \n  * Mama Poptops babies no longer drop loot\n  \n  * the Nano-Tether is much more easily controlled\n  \n  * Dark Caverns: you can no longer get trapped by the vertical door by the lake\n  \n  * Evil Crunchy Chicks will no longer cause crashes when you devour them like the soulless, black-hearted monster you are.\n  \n_____________________________________________________\n  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.235^reset;\n  \n  * Dark Caverns dungeon entrance on Lush biomes no longer appears in the mines, and instead generates on the planet surface. This should hopefully stop it failing the generate, and allow it to be a bit more interesting to come across.\n  \n  * Dark Caverns dungeon now presents you with the Distortion Sphere\n  \n  * Dark Caverns has been adjusted to be more puzzle-y\n  \n  * Outpost tech scientist no longer offers the DistortionSphere tech/mission\n  \n  * Ice Wastes no longer generate the weird 'wtf ice field' terrain type. Dark Ice Wastes, however, still do. This terrain type has been slightly changed, however, and should have a couple variants\n  \n  * commented out unused checkArmor in bear sets. using it woulda caused an error due to lack of level variable. (kherae)\n\n  * elder set damage bonus swapped to effectiveMultiplier (kherae)\n\n  * setbonuses_common now correctly handles effectiveMultiplier, instead of ignoring it. Result...enforcer OP with increased 40% total output, instead of 20%. suggest nerf. same follows for most sets using effectiveMultiplier now. They need retuning to more manageable numbers. (kherae)\n\n  * converted numerous ranged weapon animation files into a single all-purpose file. This shouldn't impact you, but you might experience a eof once before it rights itself.\n  \n  * new look for Incinerator and its upgrades, Nomad Assault Rifle, Nomad Sniper Rifle and the Gauss set (TimothyWiggins)\n  \n  * Nomad Assault Rifle and Nomad Sniper Rifle now have upgrades\n  \n  * Silicon Boards require 1 less Silicon\n  \n  * Mining Bench requires Tungsten rather than Iron to craft\n    \n  * RENAME: Mining Bench is now known as the Tool Upgrade Table\n  \n  * Increased upgrade cost in Tool Upgrade Table by +1 Manipulator Module per tier. At 3 per tier, your total cost to reach tier 8 should be roughly 108.\n  \n  * some minor corrections to the Tool Upgrade Table script\n  \n  * You can now upgrade Mech Repair Tools in the Tool Upgrade Table\n  \n  * you can now extract your old mining lasers and mech repair guns in exchange for MM modules\n\n  * Superior Bug Net is now obtained via upgrading the net in the Tool Upgrade Table, rather than as a separate recipe. It can be upgraded one further time to become the Ultra Bug Net.\n  \n  * labtable and simple teleporter have corrected collision (TimothyWiggins127)\n  \n  * damagebonus status effects swapped to multiplicative modifier\n  \n  * Spacefarer and Spacefarer Adv armors display the proper bonuses (Zero-G Immunity removed, as it hasnt been on the armor for months! my bad!)\n  \n  * Fixed foodgoods item giving electronicgoods currency (zimberzimber)\n  \n  * fu_generic* proper fix (variables needed to be local. (kherae)\n\n  * there's now a dummy effect that can be applied to block movement abilities. (kherae)\n  \n  * removed unused variable bounds from shadowgasfx and shadowgasfx2 (kherae)\n  \n_____________________________________________________\n  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.234^reset;\n  \n  * mining laser base model should properly unlock on tinkertable access\n  \n  * mining bench should properly consume modules\n_____________________________________________________\n  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.233^reset;\n  \n  * Mining Laser revamp: Rather than make several versions of mining lasers, upgraded at in a nanofabricator, and then upgraded in a mining bench, all Mining Lasers now stem from the basic model. They no longer upgrade in crucibles, but still upgrade as before within the Mining Bench. \n    * note that the old models remain, for now, but will not for much longer. You will not be able to craft them any longer.\n  \n  * Mining Bench now uses Manipulator Modules once more\n  \n  * damage bonuses on Armor Sets and Battle Packs have been changed to work multiplicatively.
