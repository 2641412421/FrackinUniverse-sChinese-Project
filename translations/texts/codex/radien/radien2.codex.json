      "Eng": "Radien deny the idea of a Cultivator creating the six races and six artifacts. Despite them being so religious, they are oddly advocates of evolution. Studying their history books, we find no mention of a Cultivator, but plenty of mention of a great 'CREATOR'. The name is disputed, though a small majority claims its name is 'Xuveh'. Having not heard of this being before, we have little reason to believe it exists."
