Thelusians have been seen to viciously defend Radiens (even strangers!) without any real explanation as to why. Radiens, when pressed, have stated only that it is 'the way things are, and always have been'. Personally, I think the reasons are lost to history unless Thelusians have long-term racial memory they might one day tell the galaxy about."
