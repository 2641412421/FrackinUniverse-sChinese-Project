During the defense of their world Crenshaw IX against the Florans, they decimated the opposition in a matter of minutes using constantly shifting formations not unlike moving fractal patterns. This mistake was repeated once more by the Apex, fifty years later, in their ill-advised expansion attempt into Thelusian territory. Since then, none have dared to challenge them in open warfare."
