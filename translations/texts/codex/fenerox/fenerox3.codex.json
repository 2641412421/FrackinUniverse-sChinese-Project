They prefer to use hand gestures to 'sign' their words as they speak, and any amount of teaching them letters is met with doubt or annoyance. They move very swiftly, and writing (accoring to them) takes entirely too long. One even mentioned that he would be old and grey by the time he learned to write, because it was too boring and took too long to figure out."

This is undoubtedly due to how their speech organs operate, and no fault of their own. We've attemtped to create a modified version that they can use to at least approximate the vowel and consonant sounds."
