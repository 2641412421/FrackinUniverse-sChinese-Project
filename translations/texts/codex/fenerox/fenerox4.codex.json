We failed to take into account their particularly unique pair-bonding mechanism their kind practices. It seems that once they imprint, they are unwilling to separate from the target of their bond. Ever."

There is a positive to this, thankfully - Fenerox are highly capable hunters and intensely ferocious if their pair-bonds are threatened. This is likely a holdover from eons of unchanged mating habits. As such, we have not been cheated on a deal in over 3 solar cycles. Our profits are up, because nobody wants to risk the wrath of our new 'guard dogs'"
