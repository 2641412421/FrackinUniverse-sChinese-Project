      "Chs": "这群特殊的费内洛克斯人是如何来到这里的，我们不得而知。但他们表现出了超越了他们在其他世界的同类的一种能力——在技术和表达能力方面。这已经给了他们一个良好的开端。我们估计，他们将在200年内自己到达恒星。我们将派遣一艘飞船帮助他们度过8个太阳周期。这将给我们的交易者时间准备充足的资源。希望他们愿意交易他们的宝贵的三氮化铟——这玩意被证明在为“方舟”舰队“卡西尼号”打造新系列的超光速驱动器方面具有特殊的价值。"
      "Eng": "How this particular group of Fenerox came to be here is unknown, but they show a capacity above and beyond their kin found on other worlds for technology and language. This has given them a head-start already, and we estimate they will have reached the stars on their own within 200 years anyhow. We will send a ship to help them along in 8 solar cycles. This should give our traders time to prepare sufficient resources to offer them. Hopefully they will be willing to trade their valuable Tritanium, as it will prove exceptionally valuable in fashioning a new line of FTL drives for Ark Fleet Cassini."

      "Chs": "在参宿七小行星系的第三颗行星上发现了这条疑似纯天然的钛（原文为“tritanium”，疑似笔误）的新矿脉，这给了我们一个尝试提升的绝佳机会。对于那些没有意识到的基尔霍斯精英来说，提升就是当我们选择取一个小物种以加速进入他们的银河社区之时。我们向他们提供商品和技术，以换取他们的资源，这对双方都有利。作为额外的奖励，我们之后会有一个宝贵的新贸易伙伴，可以代表我们在摄政议会发言。"
      "Eng": "The discovery of this new vein of what appears to be natural tritanium on the third planet of the Rigel Minoris system gives us the perfect chance to attempt an Uplifting. For those among the Kirhosian elite that are not aware, an Uplifting is when we elect to take a minor species and speed up their introduction to the galactic community. We offer them goods and technology in exchange for their resources, and both benefit. As an added bonus, later down the line, we have a valuable new trade partner that may speak on our behalf in the Protectorate Assembly."
