Unfortunately, around the same time, they exhausted all resources on their homeworld required to utilize their knowledge. What followed was a series of brutal wars that devastated their infrastructure and led to them fleeing for the stars."

It was a century, perhaps longer, before a viable replacement was located deep in the asteroid belts near Azakon Reticuli."
