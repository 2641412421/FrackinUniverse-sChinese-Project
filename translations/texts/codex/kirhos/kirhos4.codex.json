      "Eng": "When they reach the age of 22, Kirhos are considered formal adults. At this point, Corporate entities are permitted by government to approach the young rodents with offers of employment. Typically these are entry-level positions, the most sought after being Exploration, Scientific or Data-Smith Contracts. These three career paths are considered to be the highest possible honor, and competition is fierce."
