      "Eng": "We've confined MacReady to the labs. He's totally lost it. At least we can seal the door remotely and he can be holed up with that...thing. We all decided that I should investigate beyond where I found the thing...see if there is anything more to this strangeness beyond the cliffs. I'll need a ^orange;grappling hook of some sort^white; to make any real progress."
