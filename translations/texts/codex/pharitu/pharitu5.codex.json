      "Eng": "As for their first forays into space, we should be envious. Using their Shakti, a Pharitu is able to shape more than just stone. It turns out they are capable psionics, and can utilize these 'powers' to communicate into the minds of others via telepathy(unsettling, but that is how every Pharitu communicates with others), or with each other over extreme distances (at great drain to their Shakti, mind you), shape stone and metal, and even create constructs of solid matter capable of acting as fuel for ships...ships made of material they themselves molded with their minds."
