If this were the case, and the planetary rotation led to this hole moving across the heavens to shine upon the world below, there would be a concentrated beam of light that could quite literally scorch entire regions on a seasonal basis."

While it is true that there is precedent due to their rather unfortunate reaction to direct sunlight (its lethal to several branches of their lineage, though merely toxic and causes reactions similar to anaphylaxis in most), it is unlikely that this would cause a gross cultural terror of the level we see."
