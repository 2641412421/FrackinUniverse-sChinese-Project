      "Chs": "据说，当雄性的厄休安吸收红色水晶时，会导致性变态，然后与不止一条族人进行交配，而雌性吸收的绿色水晶也会导致同样的结果。据说，蓝色水晶中的任何一种都能带来性快感，但前提是它是天蓝色的。显然青色会导致精神错乱。这很可能不是事实，而更可能是受教条主义原则的严重影响。",
      "Eng": "Allegedly, red crystals when imbibed by a male Eld'uukhar, result in a `sexual deviant that will mate with more than one dragon`, while a green crystal ingested by a female will cause the same effect. A blue crystal by either is said to bring euphoria, but only if it is sky blue. Cyan will lead to psychosis...apparently. This is likely not fact, and more than likely heavily influenced by dogmatic principles."

Most specifically, it details her literal link to all crystalline formations in the universe. The importance of the Male and Female Purpose are spoken of in great detail, likely pointing to a gender-based role-heavy society in the historical context. The effects of various crystals on the genders is explored in excruciatingly boring detail."
