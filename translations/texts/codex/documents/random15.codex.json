Leaving their jungle huts safely out of my sight, it was only upon reaching the clearing where I had parked my shuttle that it now became clear that my choice of parking spot was a dire mistake.

But my shuttle is too damaged for anything but the laziest of evasions, I pray aloud that my ship won't be struck; the ablative plating already having been crumpled into a very expensive ball."
