      "Chs": "原始的耳廓狐是已建立的星际秩序间的新成员。他们的技术水平普遍较低，只有少数人已经超越了狩猎采集的生活方式。这些夜间活动的猎人非常擅长他们的手艺，出手敏捷而致命。",
      "Eng": "The primitive Fenerox are new to the established galactic order. Their tech is generally rather low, and only a few have moved beyond their hunter-gatherer lifestyle. These nocturnal hunters are exceptional at their craft, and are agile and deadly."
